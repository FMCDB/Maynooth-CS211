# Maynooth-CS211
Algorithms and Data Structures II 

This was the main programming module for Maynooth University Computer Science Year 2 Semester 2

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/FMCDB/Maynooth-CS211/blob/master/Lab1.java">Lab 1</a> - Write a Java program which takes in a line from the user (using Scanner) and then outputs (i) The sentence in ASCII (ii) Each letter in the sentence and its frequency</li><br>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/FMCDB/Maynooth-CS211/blob/master/Lab2.java">Lab 2</a> - Convert a character String into a binary string using Huffman encoding.</li><br>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/FMCDB/Maynooth-CS211/blob/master/Lab3.java">Lab 3</a> - Sort a long list of words by the 'greatest' character in that word (Furthest along in the alphabet).</li><br>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/FMCDB/Maynooth-CS211/blob/master/Lab5.java">Lab 5</a> - Write a program that takes in a sentence from the user, and outputs that sentence in Morse code. </li><br>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/FMCDB/Maynooth-CS211/blob/master/Lab6.java">Lab 6</a> - Given the public key of an encrypted message's recipient and the cipher used to encrypt it, extract the message.</li><br>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/FMCDB/Maynooth-CS211/blob/master/Lab7.java">Lab 7</a> - Insert all the words in a goven file into a hash table and then find them all again with the minimum number of collisions.</li><br>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/FMCDB/Maynooth-CS211/blob/master/Lab8.java">Lab 8</a> - Write a program which reads in two locations (longitude,latitude) and finds the precise distance in km between them.</li>
  </ul>
